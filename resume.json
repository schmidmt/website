    "Hi, I'm <b><span itemprop=\"name\"><span itemprop=\"givenName\">Michael</span> <span itemprop=\"additionalName\">T.</span> <span itemprop=\"familyName\">Schmidt</span></span></b>. <span itemprop=\"description\"> I am an experienced mathematician, physicist, programmer, systems administrator, and teacher. Presently, I am the <span itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Upper-School Mathematics Teacher</span> at the Fulton School in St. Albans, Missouri.</span>",
     "While most of my education is in physics, I think of myself as a mathematician. I have preferred the rigor of math and it's application to physics to the more surveying methods in a physics treatment.",
     "Additionally, I have worked in distributed computing, both on the operations and programmer sides. I find great satisfaction within this work as it combines all of my passions: math, physics, and computer science.",
     "In the greater sense, my goal is to broaden my understanding of the world and use that knowledge to create novel solutions to seemingly intractable problems."

In equiaffine geometry, there is no invariant notion of inner product on tangent vectors that is preserved by the full equiaffine symmetry group. Nevertheless, it is possible to define an invariant notion of arc length for nondegenerate curves, and an invariant first fundamental form for nondegenerate surfaces in equiaffine space. This leads to two possible notions of arc length for a curve contained in a surface, and these two arc length functions do not necessarily agree. In this paper we will derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which the two arc length functions do agree, and illustrate with examples.",
